This dataset is a modified version of the Car Evaluation Database in:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation

Each row in the dataset represents a car. The fields for each car are:

Fields:

PRICE: Buying price
MAINT: Maintenance price
DOORS: Number of doors
PERSONS: Capacity in terms of persons to carry
SAFETY: Estimated safety of the car. Possible values: low, med, high.
CLASS: Is the car acceptable? Possible values: unacc (unacceptable), acc (acceptable)

Note that CLASS is, precisely, the class. So, it should not be used to perform clustering but to validate it.
